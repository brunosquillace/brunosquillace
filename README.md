- 👋 Hi, I’m @brunosquillace
- 👀 I’m interested in .. helping people make the most of their lives. Whether it's doing construction work for them or investing their money and 100% guaranteeing them in such short periods of time they will make more than than they ever imagined. And the great thing is you don't need a lot of money to get started or invest. People think you need all kinds of money to invest but that's not the case.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... More and more everyday. Especially in the tech world and the more knowledge you have and the more knowledge that I have acquired the easier it is for me to help others out and that is my primary goal..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Projects with GitHub and work with them on a daily basis as much as possible so we could all make money together and help others out as well...
- 📫 How to reach me ...484-721-7781 That's my business cell phone and you can call me day or night.... ANYTIME 24/7. BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN BEING AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES FOR YOUR CLIENTS
